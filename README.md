## Greetings!
I'm Antonin Suzor, a french developer and student at EPITA.

I started studying IT because I wanted to make programs that would help people and make them happy.

## I'm interested in:
- Rust 🦀
- Java 🍵
- C ⚙️
- TypeScript 🟦
- Svelte 🟠
- Tauri 🔁
- Spring 🌱

I'd love to someday participate in a project with multiple people, feel free to contact me in any way !
